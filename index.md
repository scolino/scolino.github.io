Hello, I am Stefanie Colino, and welcome to my DREAM project! A little about me and how I ended up reseasrching CS curricular analytics: 

I live in Boston with my husband and 4-year old Cavapoo, Bruschi (yes, we are a Patriots family!). I am currently a MSCS student at Northeastern through the Align program, which is a wonderful program designed for non-CS undergrads to dive into the world of technology.  Like many of my colleges in the Align program, my journey into CS was not a straight forward path.  I graduated from Villanova in 2013 with a BA in psychology, concentrating in cognitive science.  At the time, I was interested in getting a PhD in child cognitive psychology and spent the summer before senior year interning at Temple University's Infant and Child Lab.  At some point during my senior year, I realized I wanted to make an impact on learning (but not necessarily research cognitive psychology) after taking an education policy course.  This prompted me to purse a MA in Political Science, focusing in policy and public administration, at Villanova. During and immediantly after my masters, I had the oppertunity to work with Research for Action, a education research and evaluation non-profit in Philadelphia. I loved the work that I was doing and was able to conduct both qualitive and quantitiative research on a one-to-one laptop program as well as an evaluation of afterschool programs.  When I moved to Boston, lost track of that path withind education research and worked in data/analytics focused roles at Massachusetts Society of CPAs and Liberty Mutual Insurance.  Thou the one thing that connected my work in research with my work at Liberty was my love for data and analytics.  While at Liberty, I decided to go back to school for a second masters in Computer Science to develop my machine learning knowledge and expand my technical abilities.  It wasn't until a class I took during summer 2023 that I discover that I could combine computer science and education.  This reignited my passion for education and led me to my current research project.  I am very excited to be working with Albert Lionelle and Northeastern's Center for Inclusive Computing.
