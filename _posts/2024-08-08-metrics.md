title: The Metrics Used in this Study
---

To understand the impact of a curriculum on diversity within undergraduate CS programs, two main metrics are used in our study: overall curriculum structural complexity and normalized female completions. 

### Overall Structural Complexity of a Curriculum
To understand differences in a curriculum, I use a quantitative metric of structural complexity that takes into account the flow of pre-req classes within a program's curriculum.  A past blog post goes into detail about curricular complexity and the methodology behind the metric.

[What is Curricular Analytics and Why do We Care?](_posts/2024-07-31-curricular_analytics.md)

To obtain the complexities for the CS programs, I used https://www.curricularanalytics.org/.  This is an open source website which allows users to upload a spreadsheet outling a curriculum's courses and the prerequisits structure.  This is a time consumming process as all the classes need to be manually entered and curriculums/pre-reqs need to be obtained from university websites.  Once the files are uploaded, the site creates an acyclic directed graph for the curriculum and calculates the corrisponding metrics. A sample graph is below.

### Normalized Female Completions
In this project, we are focused on female diversity within undergraduate CS programs. To measure diversity, we could simply look at the percent of CS graduates who are female, however, with this approach, we are not taking into account the diversity in the school overall.  For example, if the percent of females within a school's CS graduating class is 20%, this may signal that female diversity is low. However, if for the school overall, females only make-up 15% of graduates, the computer science major is doing a better job then the school overall at attracting gender diversity.
