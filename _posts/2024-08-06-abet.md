title: To ABET or Not to ABET..A Overview of CS Accredication Requirements
---
Since my DREAM project is focusing on the ABET accredidations, this blog post will focus on the requirements schools need to meet in order to have thier computer science programs ABET accredited. This is meant to be an informative blog post and not a stance on wether or not schools should seek ABET accredidation.


Founded in 1982, ABET is non-profit organization who has put together a sets of accredidation requirements for Engineering and Technology college programs.
