title: To ABET or Not to ABET..A Overview of CS Accredication Requirements
---
Since my DREAM project is focusing on the ABET accredidations, this blog post will focus on the requirements schools need to meet in order to have thier computer science programs ABET accredited. This is meant to be an informative blog post and not a stance on wether or not schools should seek ABET accredidation.


Founded in 1982, ABET is non-profit organization who has put together curriculum accredidation requirements for Engineering and Technology college programs.  As part of the requirements for Computer Science, a school must put together a set of program objectives and student performance evaluated against those objectives. ABET provides a list of student outcomes that programs need to impliment. 

**Student Outcomes:**
1. Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
2. Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
4. Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in
computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
5. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities
appropriate to the program’s discipline.
6. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions. [CS]

Most importantly to our study, ABET also provides curriculum guidelines that programs must implement to gain accredidation.

**Curriculum Requirements:**
For CS, the curriculum must consist of 40 credit hours (or equivilent) of computing instruction. Topics must include:
1. Substantial coverage of algorithms and complexity, computer science theory, concepts of programming languages, and software development.
2. Substantial coverage of at least one general-purpose programming language.
3. Exposure to computer architecture and organization, information management, networking and communication, operating systems, and parallel and distributed computing.
4. The study of computing-based systems at varying levels of abstraction.
5. A major project that requires integration and application of knowledge and
skills acquired in earlier course work.

In addition, students must have at least 15 semester credit hours (or equivalent) of math at the rigor of intro calculus or higher and include discrete math, probability, and statistics. A science component is also required with coursework that uses the scientific method in a non-computing area.
