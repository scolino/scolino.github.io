[Initial Comparisions of Female Representation in ABET/non-ABET Curriculums](_posts/2024-08-12-overall-comparisons.md) 

 While the preliminary results of this study provide insight into the impact of ABET accredited curriculum on complexity and  representation of women, the study does not address why ABET accredited curriculum  tend to have higher complexity. I suspect that some of the increased complexity can be attributed to the math requirements of ABET accredidation.

Further, for the schools in the sample, the majority of the ABET accredited programs were located within the School of Engineering, while the non-ABET programs varied more in the academic school that contained CS.  This brings up the question of whether ABET is driving our results or if the results are a function of the school containing the CS program. This makes sense that CS programs in the School of Engineering would mostly be ABET accredited, as other engineering programs would also be ABET accredited and the general education requirements for engineering schools would require more upper level math courses.

Current follow-up research is being conducted to look at the impact of academic school placement on curricular complexity and representation of women. Preliminary results show that CS programs with the School of Engineering do have higher complexity. The next steps in this research is to parse apart the effects of ABET accreditation and school placement.  One question we aim to address is if the complexities of ABET curriculum tend to be higher across the various academic colleges or just in programs located in the school of engineering.
