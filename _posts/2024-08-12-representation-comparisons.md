title: Representation of Women in ABET/non-ABET Curriculums
---

We first analyzed the representation of women for all schools. The below figure shows the distributions of the percentage of CS graduates who are women for ABET and Non-ABET schools.

These differences in distributions become even more pronounced when looking at the "top" ABET and non-ABET programs. "Top" schools were determined by sorting the ABET and non-ABET schools based on percent women graduates and then selecting the first 20 schools in each category.  On average, for the "top" programs, 33% of students graduating with a CS major from non-ABET programs were women, whereas for ABET programs, 21% were women.

By looking at the "top" schools, we can see that even the best of the best ABET schools in terms of representation of women still fall behind the non-ABET school with the greatest representation of women.
