title: Curricular Complexities of ABET/non-ABET Curriculums
---

After mapping the curriculums for the 80 (40 ABET and 40 non-ABET) schools, we are able to analyze the differences in the structural complexities of the two groups. The below image shows the distributions of the complexities for the "top" programs.

The curriculum of ABET programs on average is more complex than the non-ABET programs. Differences were significant where the average complexity for ABET and non-ABET is 225 and 108 respectively.  

The image below plots the "top" programs by complexity and representation of women.

Interestingly, the complexities for ABET programs do not go below 150, with the exception of a few schools.  Those that fell below 150 had minimal math requirements compared to the rest of the ABET programs. We wonder if ABET requirements unintentionally impose a systemic barrier (and/or an interpretation of the requirements) that reduces the representation of women.
